# WIBSEC Blog Dev

This repo is the content generation root for the [WIBSEC blog](https://blog.watchitburn.net).
If you are a contributor, you will need the correct environment to test your posts locally before submitting a PR:

1. prepare an isolated space for the environment (VM works great)
2. Install Jekyll
3. Install npm
4. Install [chalk](https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk) 


Once you have a working environment capable of serving the blog locally for your review, your steps to produce content for it should be as follows:

1. clone or update this repo to your local environment
2. follow the naming convention and create a new .md file in `_posts/`
3. write your content to the new file, following the syntax available from the chalk sample
4. generate a pull request for this repo.  submissions will be reviewed by the administrator for publication.
