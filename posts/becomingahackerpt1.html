<p><em>Disclaimer: This is the personal story, for the resources go to Pt. II</em></p>

<p><strong>A little background</strong></p>

<p>I had a terrible childhood. The worst came around when I told my parents I was gay.</p>

<p>So when the time came around to start my freshman year of college,  I knew I couldn’t rely on my parents for anything. That was fine but the thing is that when you are alone for the first time in your life, sometimes the mental health issues pop up and leave you shaking. My depression and anxiety got so bad because up until that time I had been on full survival mode. I flunked out of every class that I took both semesters. I just couldn’t handle my anxiety and depression and I didn’t even know how to even look for help.</p>

<p>So I moved to Colorado at the end of the school year to escape being close to my family and to be with my girlfriend of the time.</p>

<p>A lot of life happened during this time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Call center jobs</li>
  <li>Married</li>
  <li>Wife’s graduation</li>
  <li>Getting sick</li>
  <li>Wife going through some issues</li>
  <li>car accident</li>
  <li>Unemployed</li>
  <li>Back to home state to get a job</li>
</ul>

<p>So back in my home state and I needed to get a job quickly. I applied to many places but didn’t get any callbacks. The meatpacking factory close to home was the only thing hiring and so I applied to be a QA. I got a call back the next day and an interview the following day. I took the job.
I had never been inside such a factory. There was blood and pieces of meat everywhere. It was so cold. I hated it but I needed to work to be able to support my wife and myself.</p>

<p><em>So how to become a hacker then?</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Go through a devastating divorce that leaves you questioning every decision up until now</strong></p>

<p>So step 1 is not ideal, especially at 22, but it’s a starting point. I didn’t have a plan for “what if I get divorced at 22.”</p>

<p>I knew I had to get a college degree because my background would make it harder to get a good job without it.
Luckily, a couple months before the divorce I decided to invest in a thing that would make me happy: a gaming laptop.  All I knew was that I wanted to play FPS games and a gaming laptop would allow me to do that and take it on the go.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:  Video Games? Puzzles?</strong></p>

<p>So in no time I was playing Rainbow Six Siege, a first person shooter game. I wouldn’t get home until about 2 a.m. in which without a doubt I would turn on my laptop and start playing. That was my form of escape from a job in an industry that is plagued with racism and workplace violations.</p>

<p>One gaming session led to meeting some friends that invited me to their Discord server. At first we were just cordial and just played games but as virtual friendships go, it blossomed. So that’s quite the preamble to say: I met a little shit.  Let’s call Jed.</p>

<p>Up to this point I knew nothing about computers or close to nothing. I quit the job at the meatpacking factory as I wanted to do something else with my life. My divorce request came in. So I started thinking about what I should do with my life. I enrolled in a few business classes at the local community college. Mostly just to get back into taking college classes and to prove to myself that I could handle it. I was able to pass the classes but they weren’t interesting enough. So I asked Jed about what he did. Now, Jed can be very shy at first but once you get him going… Anyway, he showed me bandit.overthewire.org. Like many before me, this introduction was quite frustrating as a first foray into Linux. But it was a puzzle and I needed to see it through its completion.</p>

<p>Then Jed told me about C.</p>

<p>And guys and gals and dear nonbinary pals, that was it. Puzzles, all day long? Sign me up. So I immediately started asking all the questions. It was frustrating that I couldn’t learn it all in a day but I was surely going to try. Jed helped me through it all and often would inundate my Discord messages with a plethora of resources that I didn’t know what do with…yet. Most importantly, through it all, Jed kept insisting that I could do it. At times when my anxiety would get the best of me, I just had to look at his words to remind myself that this person who had yet to meet me IRL believed in me.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Get diagnosed with ADHD, maybe take out a lot of student loans for a CS degree?</strong></p>

<p>By the time I was able to get finances in order, the fall semester had already started so I couldn’t go back to school at the time. Instead, I got a job doing some data entry. The monotony was such that all of the workers had favorite podcasts that they would discuss during breaks. During this time I started noticing that there were some days that I could not, for the life of me, pay attention to my work. I became worried and I went to my primary doctor. They referred me to specialists and I was tested for ADHD. DING DING DING DING! So at age 23 I was finally diagnosed with ADHD and given the proper medication. This diagnosis could have saved me many painful experiences in the past but I was just grateful I knew what it was now. I was ready to start school and get into the CS program so I could have a structure on what to learn.</p>

<p>I went back to school for the Spring semester of 2020.</p>

<p>So yes the pandemic hit. But in the midst of chaos and with tons of precautions I was able to take all my classes online and continue my education.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Jed laid out a plan that he said I might want to do for infosec. Getting entry level jobs in infosec can be daunting and at times just plain difficult so anything that would make me stand out as a candidate I would do. The hard part was:** ALL OF IT.**</p>

<p>The first step in his plan seemed so out there. No way. It was an internship at a big corporation that was very selective about its interns. I didn’t pay much attention at the time since I was still very, very new and the thought of being able to pass any technical questions I might be asked seemed so ridiculous.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Become a 1337 Haxor</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward Spring 2021.</p>

<p>Jed doesn’t give up easily and he can be quite demanding when he sets his mind. He was able to petition a friend for a referral for me for the big corporation for the internship. There was first a video interview, a second face-to-face interview, and a final interview that took half a day. I did well enough in the interviews that I was offered the internship and I took it.</p>

<p>The internship helped me learn so much about web app testing, writing reports, what an initial team call looks like, working with others on an assessment, etc.
The team was very welcoming and are some of the nicest people always willing to teach.</p>

<p>Thankfully after the internship ended I was offered a position after graduation. **Of course I took it. **</p>

<p><strong>The In-Between</strong></p>

<p>I have also done a lot of self-learning through resources sent by Jed and the rest of the crew. A lot of programming thanks to classes,my own interests, and friends walking me through programs. A lot of time spent on TryHackMe or HackTheBox Academy. Many discussions with Jed about the infosec world and more. But those resources will be covered in part II.</p>

<p>People often say “network, network, network” as a way to advance in this life and they are right. I’m extremely lucky I was able to meet Jed and the rest of our crew because they have all contributed in my learning. Many have sat down with me and walked me through Wireshark exercises, many have shown me how to code complex programs, and many have taught me the history of hacking. There’s so much more I can say about having a great group of friends that support you. I was lucky, but if you are already following some Discord groups don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. Always be cautious of strangers and take stuff with a grain of salt if you have just met them but try to expand your network because “everyone has something to teach you.”</p>

<p>Until next time…</p>
